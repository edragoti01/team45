Task 4 notes

###Use ros actions###

Detecting start colour:

Array of potential colours and mask values

Turn around

Borrow code from colour_search.py

for i in ....
    if camera input == mask[i]
        target colour = .....


Exploring? Or predetermined route?

While colour not detected:

    Follow_route() -- returns True if colour found?

Follow route function -->
        Colour detected function -->
                Beaconing function 


If colour detected

Head to three predetermined locations? Not very adaptable

Explore? Time wasting

Odometry - never go back to start
Record start position and prevent it from returning to it
Try to go in circle? Follow outside wall?
Explore until target colour spotted?


1. Get start colour working
2. Get the robot to explore and never return to the start
